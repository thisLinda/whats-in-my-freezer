## :star2: About this Project

Tackling the challenge of building my first app! I decided on the MERN stack to familiarize myself with MongoDB and Express.

That wasn't enough of a hurdle so I decided to learn by incorporating [Ant Design](https://ant.design/) a "UI Design Language and React UI library."
