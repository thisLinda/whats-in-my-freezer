# Getting Started!

Tackling a personal and much-needed app.

Challenging myself with new learning by incorporating [Ant Design](https://ant.design/) rather than Bootstrap or MUI.

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.
